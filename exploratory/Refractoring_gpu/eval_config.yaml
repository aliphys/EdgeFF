# ============================================================================
# Evaluation Configuration for Inference Metrics
# ============================================================================
# This config specifies which W&B sweep to evaluate for inference performance.
# Used by: python eval.py --config eval_config.yaml
#
# The eval script will:
#   1. Download trained models from the specified sweep
#   2. Run inference at each batch_size in inference_batch_sizes
#   3. Measure latency and energy (on Jetson devices)
#   4. Log results to W&B as an 'eval' job type
# ============================================================================

# Sweep containing trained models to evaluate
sweep_id: 9xqabsi3                   # Replace with your sweep ID

# Dataset must match what models were trained on
dataset: MNIST                      # MNIST | FMNIST | SVHN | CIFAR10

# Batch sizes to test for inference throughput analysis
inference_batch_sizes: [1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]

# Hardware monitoring interval (Jetson only)
# Lower values = more accurate energy measurement, higher overhead
